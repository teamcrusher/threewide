# Project activity #5 (Team-based project work)

## Project storytelling & live demo/presentation

### Preliminary 

This activity is about telling your team's project story (a "_there and back again_" of sorts), from its initial conception, to its planning, to its execution (and delivery), to its closing (the end of the class). It is expected that teams will highlight all of the hills and valleys they had along the way, discussing internal team discussions, design, and development decisions and directions, as well as feedback from the instructor and other ENSE 374ers and how the feedback did or didn't alter the course of project work. Teams will also demo their project. It is expected that at least one MVP is created - a useful "chunk" of work that aims to get the "who" (the customer stakeholder), or a subset of stakeholders, up and running in some useful way.  All project files are due in GitHub and the team's URCourses wiki (final vlog only). Timestamps will be confirmed.

- Teams will be selected to either present on November 28, 2022, or November 30, 2021, between 10:00 am and 11:15 am (our normal class time) and be expected to demo their working software
- Teams will get a 10-15-minute time-box for the presentations.
- Timely attendance on both days is required by all students

**NOTE**: Project teams will have a [[Activity 5 - SCRUM w Tim | 5-9 minute scrum]] with the instructor on November 16, 2022 sometime between 10:00 am - 11:15 am, during our normally scheduled class time to go over team progress and ensure teams are on-track**.** Attendance during your team's scrum time is mandatory with non-attendance incurring project activity grade deduction, upwards to the full project activity grade allocation. If a team member absolutely cannot attend, the instructor requires a 48-hour notification prior to the team/instructor scrum date/time. Students also must supply necessary documentation justifying and rationalizing their non-attendance

#### Deliverables must include

- [x] Exceptional scrum and presentation professionalism ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Up-to-date project documents/documentation as per previous activities in GitHub ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Project MVP code in GitHub. NOTE: At least 1 complete MVP is a requirement ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Up-to-date GitHub Project Board (Kanban) with envisioned future user stories (high-level)/MVPs (with "done" activities represented as such) ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Project installation requirements and installation instructions in GitHub ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Project presentation files (any PPTs or scripts used to demo your team's project) in GitHub. See "Presentation criteria" below to help guide your final presentation content and demo ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Final project commercial/vlog demonstrating the fully working project, emphasizing key interactive experiences of the completed ("done") MVP(s) (you can create the vlog like an advertisement, highlighting key experiences of your team's solution/innovation). your team's vlog should highlight and rationalize why you think what your team has accomplished fulfills a true MVP ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] The vlog should be at least 1 minute and no longer than 3 minutes. It can loosely follow the presentation requirements listed below. However, it should more focus on the why and the what of your software solution. ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Final project report in GitHub (5-10 pages (PDF), including screenshots), detailing what you created (with screenshots). Combine and "storify" documentation created throughout the project (think: would someone be able to understand what your team explored having no knowledge of your project? This is the audience for this report). What were the goals of the project? Were goals achieved? What feedback did you receive throughout? How did feedback impact/change project decisions (it at all)? Focus on discussing your team's exploration, process, used, as well as the final outcome and key user interactions created for delivered MVP(s). Include a deeper reflection and lessons learned as teams discussed in the final demo/presentation (described below under "Presentation criteria"), including a deeper reflection on all stated questions and other things like how the team/individuals overcame obstacles and frustrations (be humble, open, honest) ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Other documents as the team feels/wishes to explore ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] A highly readable, user-friendly GitHub (you might want to consider using GitHub pages (.io pages) that enable you to have a nice project website appearance (not a requirement - but a readable/useable GitHub is expected at a minimum) ✅ 2022-12-02
- [x] Individually submitted self/peer review files (MS Word .docx template), uploaded to URCourses (using "Activity #5 self/peer review submission" upload link) ✅ 2022-12-02
      **NOTE**: Self/Peer reviews may impact individual grades on team-based project work, upwards to the full activity allocation.

### Presentation criteria

Your final team presentation and demo must include the below

#### Project idea refresher

A brief refresher regarding who you are (team members), your team's project idea (problem or innovation), and team roles and responsibilities throughout the project

Discuss your team's project design architecture, linking your discussion to the various visuals your team created for this activity (including all/key diagrams, how team GitHub Project Board/Kanban, associated user stories, and envisioned MVPs and rationales were updated throughout the project (or not updated). Discuss and address how student comments provided as part of project activity #4 further evolved (or not evolved) your project idea/work

#### MVP(s) demo

Demo what you created - your working MVP. What makes it an MVP? What is the team happy with? What does the team think could potentially be better (if anything), does what the team envision for a next MVP still jive well?
